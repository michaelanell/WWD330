<h1>Week One Notes</h1>
<h2>Master Mobile UX Sitepoint</h2>

<ul>
   <li><h3>Lesson 1 - Rewrite Brain for Mobile First</h3><br>
<ul>
   <li>Start with designing for the smallest device that your code will run on
instead of desktop.
   </li>
   <li>"Whatever your are doing do mobile first" Eric Schmidt. Mobile is the 
most used device to view content on, far surpases laptop and desktop.
   </li>
   <li>"Just because your website is responsive, it doesn't mean that it is 
        mobile first."
   </li>
   <li>Responsive Retrofitting - taking what you have already created for desktop
       and making it fit on mobile. This does address some important issues such as:
      <ul>
         <li>Touch interaction issues</li>
         <li>Screen real estate</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
<li>There are easy and difficult things to designing mobile first</li>
<li>Downsides:</li>
<ul>
<li>Time consuming</li>
<li>Costly if you are rebuiling a site that already exists for desktop</li>
</ul>
<li>Upsides</li>
<ul>
<li>Taking time to redesign a site for mobile gives your users a much better 
experiance across different devices.
</li>
<li>Address size constraints of mobile size and bandwidth.</li>
<li>Makes application better ready for future growth.</li>
</ul>
<li>To Enforce Importance of Mobile First:
<ul>
<li>Desktop sales declining since 2011</li>
<li>Consumers purchase smaller devices of varying sizes at a high rate with
a high turnover</li>
<li>Companies that manufacture devices make few desktops and many more smaller
devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones.</li>
<li>Mobile is not a fad.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h3>How to Improve UX by Understanding Users</h3> <br> 
<ul>
<li>Be there - be there when your customers need you.</li>
<li>Be useful - 97% of users will leave if your application is not user friendly.</li>
<li>Be quick - make interactions smoothe and seamless. Use as little steps for users to 
accomplish what they need to with your application.</li>
<li>Reachability matters - 75% of people use their thumbs when using mobile and 49% use a one
handed grip. Easier to reach things at the bottom of the device based on grip.</li>
<li>Speed matters - delays lead to users abandoing applications.</li>
<li>Networks matter - many users dont have access to fast networks. To hekp these users have a good
experiance: <br>
<ul>
<li>Reduce image usage on site/app.</li>
<li>SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwith.</li>
<li>Optimize and minify CSS and JS files</li>
<li>GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<li><h3>Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design</h3><br>
<ul><li>Make software easier to use.</li>
<li> Make most commonly used menu items at the bottom of the 
screen so they are easily reachable.</li>
<li>Placement matters - addressing reachability issues helps create a perception of speed. This
improves engagement rates and user satisfaction.</li>
<li>Understanding matters - users need to understand the purpose of your app/site features - 
hamburger menu example.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Make things simple so users can understand them easily.</li>
<li>Most web forms are too long. Something to do to make froms shorter is to use hints instead of 
labels. Using float labels also helps users.</li>
<li>Make fields bigger for users to easily touch.</li>
<li>Entering information to a mobile device is a tedious and error prone process that leads users to 
abandon the form. Enabling autofill makes the forms quicker to fill out, reduces errors, and makes users
more likely to complete the form. 
</li>
<li>Passwords matter - Entering passwords are especially difficult on mobile devices. Masking passwords 
is something that can be done away with on mobile to decrease user frustraion. Give the user the option to 
mask the passord or not with the eye symbol in the password field.</li>
<li>Numbers matter - auto advancing credit card numbers, and formatting spaces between number groups helps
users input their infomation.<br>
When taking numbers ensure the number keypad is used on mobile. Default keyboard make inputting numbers
tedious.</li>
<li>Calls matter - Dont force a copy and paste in order for users to call your number.</li>
</ul>
<li><h3>Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience</h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Pop-up advirtisments are the most detested advertisements to users. When ads get in the way of content
you loose engagment. If you are going to place ads in your site, make them small, dont let them take 
up 40-50% of your screen space. Video ads have higher converstion rates than pictures.</li>
<li>Things to remember: <br>
<li>Stop using pop-ups and pop-overs</li>
<li>Users dont visit your website to look at adds, they came for content.</li>
<li>If you use ads, make them unobstrusive. Your content comes first.</li>
</li>
</ul></li>
</li>
</ul>
