            <h3>Chapter 2: Programming Basics</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Primitive data types: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>String</li>
                        <li>Symbol</li>
                        <li>Number - just number, not float or int</li>
                        <li>Boolean</li>
                        <li>Undefined</li>
                        <li>Null</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Declaring Variables: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Const - for variables ment to stay constant</li>
                        <li>Let - for variables allowed to change</li>
                        <li>Let and const have block scope</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Naming Conventions in JavaScript <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can start with upper or lower case letters, an underscore, dollar sign</li>
                        <li>Cannot contain numbers at start, but can contain them in other parts of name</li>
                        <li>Names that start with an underscore usually refer to private properties and methods</li>
                        <li>Variable names area case sensitive</li>
                        <li>Camel case is propobably best to use for naming, but underscore separated words are also
                            often used</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Chapter 2 - Arrays</h3> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Arrays:
                    <ul>
                        <li>To declare an array in JavaScript:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>const arrayName = []; - dont have to declare size</li>
                                <li>Initializing a singe element<br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>arrayName[0] = 'value1';</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Array Literals<br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>literal - notation for representig a fixed value in source code</li>
                                        <li>arrayName = ['Value 1', 'Value 2', 'Value 3', 'Value 4', 'Value 5','Value
                                            6'];</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>You can add any type of value to an array, one array
                                    can contain a variety of data types:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>arrayName = ['Value 1', 2, [], true];</li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Removing values: <br>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>The delete operator removes array items: <br>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>delete arrayName[3] //returns undefined</li>
                                                        <li>The value at place arrayName[3] will be removed from
                                                            the array and
                                                            be replaced with value undefined - The space
                                                            myArray[3] will still
                                                            exist in the array, just the value is removed and
                                                            replaced</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>.length method - returns length of method </li>
                                                <li>.pop() method - removes the last item from an array</li>
                                                <li>.shift() method - removes the first item in an array </li>
                                                <li>.push method - appends new value to end of array</li>
                                                <li>.unshift() method - appends new items to beginning of array</li>
                                                <li>.conacat method - merge arrays</li>
                                                <li>.join() method - turn an array into a string that contains all the
                                                    items in the
                                                    array separated by commas.</li>
                                                <li>.slice() method - creates a sub array from a 'slice' of the orginal
                                                    array. It takes two
                                                    parameters - the first number refers to the item posistion of the
                                                    array that you would like to start the slice from.
                                                    The second refers to the item position of the array that you would
                                                    like to end the slice on.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>.splice() method - removes items from an array then inserts new
                                                    items into their place. It takes 3 parameters.
                                                    The first two are numbers that dictate the to and from item
                                                    positions in the array that you would like to remove. The third
                                                    is the item value that is to replace the ones you remove. You can
                                                    add more than one parameter for this purpose, and each item
                                                    will be put in place of the ones you removed in order.

                                                </li>
                                                <li>.reverse() method - reverses order of array</li>
                                                <li>.sort() method - sorts the order of array</li>
                                                <li>.indexOf() method - checks if a value exists in an array. If the
                                                    value is there the (first occurance of the) index of the item will
                                                    be returned.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Mutidimentional Arrays - an array of arrays</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Chapter 2 - Sets</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Make software easier to use.</li>
                <li> Make most commonly used menu items at the bottom of the
                    screen so they are easily reachable.</li>
                <li>Placement matters - addressing reachability issues helps create a perception of speed. This
                    improves engagement rates and user satisfaction.</li>
                <li>Understanding matters - users need to understand the purpose of your app/site features -
                    hamburger menu example.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Make things simple so users can understand them easily.</li>
                <li>Most web forms are too long. Something to do to make froms shorter is to use hints instead
                    of
                    labels. Using float labels also helps users.</li>
                <li>Make fields bigger for users to easily touch.</li>
                <li>Entering information to a mobile device is a tedious and error prone process that leads
                    users to
                    abandon the form. Enabling autofill makes the forms quicker to fill out, reduces errors, and
                    makes users
                    more likely to complete the form.
                </li>
                <li>Passwords matter - Entering passwords are especially difficult on mobile devices. Masking
                    passwords
                    is something that can be done away with on mobile to decrease user frustraion. Give the user
                    the option to
                    mask the passord or not with the eye symbol in the password field.</li>
                <li>Numbers matter - auto advancing credit card numbers, and formatting spaces between number
                    groups helps
                    users input their infomation.<br>
                    When taking numbers ensure the number keypad is used on mobile. Default keyboard make
                    inputting numbers
                    tedious.</li>
                <li>Calls matter - Dont force a copy and paste in order for users to call your number.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Pop-up advirtisments are the most detested advertisements to users. When ads get in the way
                    of content
                    you loose engagment. If you are going to place ads in your site, make them small, dont let
                    them take
                    up 40-50% of your screen space. Video ads have higher converstion rates than pictures.</li>
                <li>Things to remember: <br>
                <li>Stop using pop-ups and pop-overs</li>
                <li>Users dont visit your website to look at adds, they came for content.</li>
                <li>If you use ads, make them unobstrusive. Your content comes first.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </li>
    </ul>
