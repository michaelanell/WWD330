                </li>
                <li>Primitive data types: <br>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Symbol</li>
			<li>Number - just number, not float or int</li>
                        <li>Boolean</li>
                        <li>Undefined</li>
                        <li>Null</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Assigning and Declaring Variables: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Const - for variables ment to stay constant</li>
                        <li>Let - for variables allowed to change</li>
			<li>Let and const have block scope</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Naming Conventions in JavaScript <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can start with upper or lower case letters, an underscore, dollar sign</li>
                        <li>Cannot contain numbers at start, but can contain them in other parts of name</li>
                        <li>Names that start with an underscore usually refer to private properties and methods</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>To Enforce Importance of Mobile First:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Desktop sales declining since 2011</li>
                        <li>Consumers purchase smaller devices of varying sizes at a high rate with
                            a high turnover</li>
                        <li>Companies that manufacture devices make few desktops and many more smaller
                            devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones.</li>
                        <li>Mobile is not a fad.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Improve UX by Understanding Users</h3> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Be there - be there when your customers need you.</li>
                <li>Be useful - 97% of users will leave if your application is not user friendly.</li>
                <li>Be quick - make interactions smoothe and seamless. Use as little steps for users to
                    accomplish what they need to with your application.</li>
                <li>Reachability matters - 75% of people use their thumbs when using mobile and 49% use a one
                    handed grip. Easier to reach things at the bottom of the device based on grip.</li>
                <li>Speed matters - delays lead to users abandoing applications.</li>
                <li>Networks matter - many users dont have access to fast networks. To hekp these users have a
                    good
                    experiance: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduce image usage on site/app.</li>
                        <li>SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwith.</li>
                        <li>Optimize and minify CSS and JS files</li>
                        <li>GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Make software easier to use.</li>
                <li> Make most commonly used menu items at the bottom of the
                    screen so they are easily reachable.</li>
                <li>Placement matters - addressing reachability issues helps create a perception of speed. This
                    improves engagement rates and user satisfaction.</li>
                <li>Understanding matters - users need to understand the purpose of your app/site features -
                    hamburger menu example.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Make things simple so users can understand them easily.</li>
                <li>Most web forms are too long. Something to do to make froms shorter is to use hints instead
                    of
                    labels. Using float labels also helps users.</li>
                <li>Make fields bigger for users to easily touch.</li>
                <li>Entering information to a mobile device is a tedious and error prone process that leads
                    users to
                    abandon the form. Enabling autofill makes the forms quicker to fill out, reduces errors, and
                    makes users
                    more likely to complete the form.
                </li>
                <li>Passwords matter - Entering passwords are especially difficult on mobile devices. Masking
                    passwords
                    is something that can be done away with on mobile to decrease user frustraion. Give the user
                    the option to
                    mask the passord or not with the eye symbol in the password field.</li>
                <li>Numbers matter - auto advancing credit card numbers, and formatting spaces between number
                    groups helps
                    users input their infomation.<br>
                    When taking numbers ensure the number keypad is used on mobile. Default keyboard make
                    inputting numbers
                    tedious.</li>
                <li>Calls matter - Dont force a copy and paste in order for users to call your number.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Pop-up advirtisments are the most detested advertisements to users. When ads get in the way
                    of content
                    you loose engagment. If you are going to place ads in your site, make them small, dont let
                    them take
                    up 40-50% of your screen space. Video ads have higher converstion rates than pictures.</li>
                <li>Things to remember: <br>
                <li>Stop using pop-ups and pop-overs</li>
                <li>Users dont visit your website to look at adds, they came for content.</li>
                <li>If you use ads, make them unobstrusive. Your content comes first.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </li>
    </ul>
