    <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h2><br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Errors</h3><br>
            When there is an error in your program, it is usually caused by one of three things:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>System error - issue with system/external device the program is being played on.</li>
                <li>Program error - syntax or logic errors.</li>
                <li>User error - user entered data that the program is unable to handle.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Exceptions</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>An error that produces a return value that can help deal with the error.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Stack Traces</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Sequence of functions/method calls that find the point where the error occured in the program.</li>
                <li>Works backwards from where the error occured to find the function or method that started the error
                    sequence.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Warnings</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Warning occurs when there is an error that isn't enough to cause program to crash.</li>
                <li>Although the warning doesn't crash the program, it is good to resolve the warning errors because
                    they can result in the program running incorrectly if you do not.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Strict Mode</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Came out with ECMAScript 5.</li>
                <li>Strict mode is a way of writing js that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits using
                    depreciated features. Using strict mode results in code that is not sloppy, and is rather
                    robust, clear, and fast code.</li>
                <li>To write in strict mode add the following line of code to the start of a js file:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>'use strict';</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If the js engine you are using supports strict mode, it will pick up this line of code. If not, it
                    will be ignored.
                </li>
                <li>You can apply strict mode to individual functions in your program by doing the following: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>function strictly(){<br>
                            'use strict';</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It is recommened that you invoke strict mode by placing all of your code in a self-invoking function
                    that is set to use strict mode:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(function() {
                            'use strict';

                            // All your code would go inside this function

                            }());</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Exception Handlers - try, catch, finally</h3><br>
        <li>If you are unsure if a line of code will work and want to test it, put the code inside of a try{} block.
        </li>
        <li>Create a catch{} block to that will run if the code inside of the try{} block throws an exception. To create
            a catch block, pass the error to the catch block and write what you want to happen if an excception is
            thrown by the try block inside of the catch block.
        </li>
        <li>Lastly, to end your exception handler, add a final block after your catch block, that runs whether or not an
            exception occurrs.</li>
        </li>
        <li>Example:<br>
            function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
            'use strict';
            let answer;
            try {
            answer = String(squareRoot(number));
            } catch(error) {
            answer = squareRoot(-number)+"i";
            } finally {
            return `+ or - ${answer}`;
            }
            }
        </li>
    </ul>
