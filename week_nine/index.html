    <ul>

        <li>There is a global object in every JS enviornment. </li>
        <li>Variables created in global scope are properties of the global object.</li>
        <li>In a browser enviornment the global object is the window object.</li>
        <li>The Browser Object Model<br>
            <ul>

                    by all major browsers, available through the window object.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Avoid using the window object to refer to global variables, as it makes code better portable
            between JS eviornments.

        <li>alert(), confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object.</li>
        <li>confirm() - 'will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message
            provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel.'</li>
        <li>window.prompt() - will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided
            as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text is then returned as
            a string when the user clicks OK. </li>
        <li>eg. window.prompt('Please enter your name:');</li>
        <h2>Browser Information</h2>
